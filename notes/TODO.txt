Marking 'alpha-blockers' with +

MISC/TRIAGE
===
- autosave toggle
- in the interest of including lots of classes, maybe you should 'copy-paste' some perks/req'ts (and make it easy to do so with the class hierarchy). For example, something similar (/identical) to 'Frugivore', but for a different skill? You're already kind of doing this with e.g. horseman and gladiator.
- I think the buff constructor stuff was actually unnecessary? should probably walk it back? Bleh
+- figure out hosting/exoprting
+?- review code TODOs
+ zone/superzone unlocking
- show ancestry buff calculations in stats page
- classes/farmer style routes
    - (and have some default - either the current class, or whatever was viewed last)
+- add a 'retreat' button next to 'Stop' that ends the current action (giving no benefits) and starts a new one. I don't think it's a bad behavior to enable.

BALANCE
=======
- extra perks (other classes) as fn of max lvl with current class (or even just current lvl)
- bonus gains for zones that train multiple skills (right now I think this happens for individual *actions* that train multiple skills, but not across zones)
- concern with exponential ancestry bonus: it may quickly erase aptitudes as a distinguisher between classes
    - actually, I don't think this is a legit concern. Double is double. Whether it's 2*x or 2*100000*x.
+?- it's annoying that if my skill level in X is such that all X actions are red, there's not really anything I can do about it, other than grin and bear it. Maybe this is a good argument for cross-skill bootstrapping for multi-skill actions (i.e. really good combat skill should offset some of my bad stealth skill in a combat/stealth zone).
- Make aptitudes more divergent between classes, to encourage different strategies.
- Seems like ancestry bonus is basically just a linear multiplier on your progress speed throughout your lifetime. It follows that...
    - if we want high level zones to only be tractable with a high ancestry bonus (and/or more advanced classes), then lower level zones will be blazingly fast when those conditions are met. Is this a problem? Maybe not.
    - what if ancestry bonus was an aptitude multiplier *per player level*?

TECHNICAL
=========
- make sure it runs in the background
- figure out how to write better/more parsimonious CSS. Does angular offer less-like stuff?
- switch to attributive components?
+?- profile the thing
- should think about trying to reconcile passives and buffs (so that it's easy to make one out of the other)
- consider adding a 'debug' component where you can dump a bunch of extra information that's useful for debugging (e.g. player metadata)

MECHANICS
=========
+?- zone leveling
- item drops
- bonus zones

BUGS
====
+- have seen at least one instance where an action got 'stuck' (but was able to finish it by clicking). That's a little scary. I have a fear that my code is crawling with race conditions.
+- fill in descriptions of spells/perks
    - make 'Fruity' buffs descriptive of which skills they're buffing
+- It's questionable whether 'Fruity' should stack. It definitely shouldn't stack two instances that buff the same skill type.

IDEAS
======
- more immediate benefits/sense of progression associated with leveling up?
- actual prestiging
- associate a color with each skill?
- zone presentation. Superzones or no? Ability to sort/filter by difficulty, skills trained, etc.?
- class homages to other games (hack, FFT, disgaea)
- - allow multiple buffs of same name?
- 'second-tier' classes (with branching options, like Wesnoth, Fire Emblem, etc.)

UI
==
- nice navbar
+- spells should be more 'at hand'
- would also be nice to have keyboard shortcuts for spells
+?- distinguish in the UI between a permanently buffed stat and a temp buffed one (light green vs. dark green?)
+?- there's a weird bug where like 5% of the time the progress bar doesn't reset to 0, but uses a long transition
+?- animation when leveling up (plvl or skill). Maybe just a nice '+1' toast.
- add a nice CSS transition to progress bar when clicked
- zone difficulty UI should probably incorporate cleric perk
+- klass component: make icons in grid clickable
- color action bars by inexp. penalty?
- icons for perks?
- ticker. Where to put it, what to say in it. Current thinking: modal alerts for significant one-time-ish events? And a small scrolling action log in the focal zone view for more spammy stuff?
+ modal alerts for unlocks (and/or badge)
- unit animations
- "unlocked x/Y classes" text in classes view
- show greyed-out reincarnate button for unlocked classes when level < 10

Usability
=====
- show hints and % progress for class unlocks
    - (% progress is kind of tedious to implement, but would be really helpful)
    - Also, maybe % progress should be calculated wrt your current stats rather than lifetime best, for unlock criteria like 'reach level X in skill Y'
