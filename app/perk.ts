// This is gonna be a bitch to implement.
//
// Need to think of what categories these might fall under:
// - flat bonuses to skill/aptitude levels
// - bonuses to action speed (possibly allowing going under the 'minimum' per zone?)
// - affect chances of 'bonus zones' appearing
// - augmenting the outcome of an action when it's completed
// - inserting a new (otherwise impossible) action at action-selection time
// - random shuffling of aptitudes (that one's pretty unique)
//
// All of the above may be conditioned on criteria such as:
// - being in a particular zone (or type of zone)
// - random chance
// - having been active/inactive for some amount of time
// - day of week?
// - timer (e.g. maybe provides benefit X every 5 minutes)
// - user initiation (do we want to include 'active skills' under this perk umbrella?)
//
// Also, another type would be the providing of temporary (prob random) buffs,
// which could have the effect of any of the benefits in the first list.
