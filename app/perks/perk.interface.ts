/** Let's come up with some clear nomenclature to start.

BONUS: something that modifies the game state (usually in a good way) according
    to some particular rules/conditions. Can modify player stats, action outcomes, etc.

BUFF: a temporary bonus (usually on a timer, but may have some other
    termination condition)

(maybe) ONESHOT: a degenerate buff having duration 0.

PASSIVE: a permanent bonus (at least, permanent wrt the lifetime of the character)
    (should basically be equivalent to a buff with infinite duration)

SPELL: something that can be activated by the player (on some cooldown), which may
    confer a bonus (usually a buff, rarely a perk), or have some other effect (?)

PERK: a passive or spell associated with a particular class
