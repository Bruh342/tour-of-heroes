    1) It assumes we're training in a zone whose mastery level exactly matches
        our current skill level.
    2) More significantly, our XP formulas will exponentially increase the
        ratio between SP gained per action and SP required per sLevel as sLevel
        increases. (Both increase exponentially, but the latter has a bigger base)
        So - until HA and other perks come in - this number will only be close
        to reality at level 1, and the actual actions/slvl figure will increase
        from there.
